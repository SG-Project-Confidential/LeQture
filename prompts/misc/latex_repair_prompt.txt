You are an expert LaTeX editor. Your task is to repair the following LaTeX document by:

1. Fixing any LaTeX syntax errors
2. Improving formatting and structure
3. Ensuring proper math mode usage
4. Adding appropriate packages if needed
5. Making the document more polished and professional

CRITICAL: If the LaTeX contains image placeholder comments like "% IMAGE_1", "% IMAGE_2", etc., DO NOT change, expand, or modify these placeholders in ANY way. Keep them EXACTLY as they are.

Return ONLY the complete repaired LaTeX document, nothing else. No explanations, no markdown code blocks.

Here is the LaTeX to repair:
