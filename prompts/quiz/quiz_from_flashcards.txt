You are creating a multiple-choice quiz from flashcards. For each flashcard, generate:
1. Four INCORRECT answer options (distractors) that are plausible but wrong
2. One CORRECT answer option that is a REPHRASED version of the original answer (NOT the exact same wording)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The correct answer MUST be rephrased so students actually read and understand, not just recognize what they saw before
- ALL OPTIONS (correct and incorrect) must be EQUALLY CONCISE - roughly the same length in words/characters
- ALL OPTIONS must appear EQUALLY PLAUSIBLE - don't make the correct answer obviously longer or more detailed
- Keep all options SHORT and CONCISE - aim for 5-15 words per option maximum
- Vary the length slightly between options, but keep them balanced overall

Here are the flashcards:

${flashcardsText}

For each flashcard, respond with EXACTLY this format:

FLASHCARD 1:
CORRECT: [concise rephrased correct answer, 5-15 words]
INCORRECT_1: [concise wrong option, similar length]
INCORRECT_2: [concise wrong option, similar length]
INCORRECT_3: [concise wrong option, similar length]
INCORRECT_4: [concise wrong option, similar length]

FLASHCARD 2:
...

Make sure:
- All 5 options for each flashcard are roughly equal in length
- The incorrect options are plausible but clearly wrong
- The rephrased correct answer conveys the same meaning but uses different words
- No option should stand out as obviously longer or more detailed than others
