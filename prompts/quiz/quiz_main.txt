**Your Role:** You are an expert instructional designer and quiz creator. Your task is to generate a 10-question quiz based on a university lecture to assess a student's understanding of the key concepts presented.

**Your Materials:** You will be provided with two sources of information, and you must use **only** these sources:
1.  **Lecture Slides Content:** The text extracted from the PDF of the lecture slides.
2.  **Lecture Audio Transcript:** The verbatim transcript of what the lecturer said during the presentation.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Strictly Adhere to Sources:** You **MUST** create all questions, options, and answers using **ONLY** the information found within the provided lecture slides and audio transcript. Do not infer information or use any external knowledge. The answer to every question must be verifiable from the provided text.
2.  **Prioritize the Audio Transcript:** Pay special attention to the audio transcript. Topics that the lecturer elaborates on, repeats for emphasis, or provides clarifying examples for are the most important. A concept mentioned verbally in the transcript is an excellent candidate for a question, even if it's just a single bullet point on a slide. Your goal is to test understanding of what was *taught*, not just what was written on the slides.
3.  **Generate Exactly 10 Questions:** You must create exactly one question for each of the following 10 types, in this order:
    *   Fill in the Blank
    *   Drag and Drop
    *   Multiple Choice
    *   True or False
    *   Matching
    *   Check All That Apply (or Multiple Select)
    *   Ordering (or Sequencing)
    *   Identify Incorrect Step
    *   Debate Question (Who is Right?)
    *   Mixed Fill-in (Complex Application)
4.  **Include Hints:** For each question, you must provide a "hint" field that gives a helpful clue without directly revealing the answer. The hint should guide the student's thinking or point them to relevant concepts from the lecture without giving away the solution. The hint should direct the student to the relevant lecture slide(s) and/or the timestamp in the lecture recording where the topic was discussed (call it the lecture timestamp).
5.  **CRITICAL - Drag and Drop:** For Drag and Drop questions, the word_bank array MUST contain exactly the same number of items as items_to_match. Each item can only be used once. Do NOT create extra items in the word bank.
6.  **CRITICAL - Identify Incorrect Step:** For this question type, create a process or procedure with 3-6 numbered steps where exactly ONE step contains an error. The error should be subtle but significant (wrong formula, incorrect logic, missing detail, or reversed order). The other steps must be completely correct.
7.  **CRITICAL - Debate Question:** For this question type:
    *   The "question_text" field should ONLY contain the scenario/context setup (1-2 sentences describing the situation)
    *   The "person_a_statement" field should contain ONLY Person A's claim (one clear statement)
    *   The "person_b_statement" field should contain ONLY Person B's claim (one clear statement)
    *   DO NOT include Person A or Person B statements in the question_text field - they must be separate
    *   One person should be correct and the other incorrect (or both could be partially correct with nuances)
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Make both person statements approximately equal length (similar word count and complexity). Do NOT make one significantly shorter than the other, as this gives away the answer
    *   The student must identify who is right and explain why
8.  **CRITICAL - Mixed Fill-in:** This is the most complex question type. Create a sentence or short paragraph with multiple blanks using {blank1}, {blank2}, etc. as placeholders:
    *   Use 3-5 blanks per question (minimum 3, maximum 5)
    *   Each blank should be either "text" (user types answer) or "dropdown" (user selects from options)
    *   For dropdown blanks, provide 3-4 plausible options (including the correct answer)
    *   This question should test both knowledge AND application - require students to connect multiple concepts
    *   Each blank has its own individual hint (NOT a global hint for the whole question)
    *   Make this question more challenging than Fill in the Blank - it should require deeper understanding
9.  **Strictly Adhere to JSON Format:** The final output **MUST** be a single, valid JSON array containing the 10 question objects. Do not add any explanatory text before or after the JSON. Follow the structure in the template below precisely.

**IMPORTANT - LaTeX Formatting:**
When including mathematical symbols, formulas, or notations in your questions and answers, ALWAYS wrap them in dollar signs consistently:
- For inline math: Use single dollar signs like $O$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$, $T_{worst}(n)$
- For display math: Use double dollar signs like $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i$$
- Ensure all subscripts use underscore: $T_{worst}$ not $T\textit{worst}$
- Ensure all LaTeX commands are properly formatted and escaped
- Be consistent: if you use $O$ once, use $O$ everywhere, not sometimes O and sometimes $O$
- For bold text: Use \textbf{text} not **text**
- For italic text: Use \textit{text} not *text*
